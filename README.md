# Fake Wordle

Initial thoughts: obviously, Wordle is very trendy and showcases how a limiter and sharing functionality creates a platform where people can compete and enjoy sharing their 'wins'

Original game: [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

Goals:

- Understand logic behind the game wordle
- Create the concept and then change it to make it the way that I'd like the gameplay
- Work on it daily and showcase what is going on

## Day 1

[X] Create the board  
[X] Create an input where we can type in the initial row  
[X] Once enter is pressed, check to see if the word is correct  
[X] Make it show which letters are almost there or correct.  
[X] Go to another row if not all complete  
[1/2] If complete, show that you win.

Thoughts about Day 1: It has been a blast! Basically, it was fun just to code something together and create a robust way of how the gameplay actually works. I decided because of this day that I'd continue on the project of making it my own and working on what I would do to it.

## Day 2

To be determined...

[] Work on it. :)
