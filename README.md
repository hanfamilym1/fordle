# Fake Wordle

Initial thoughts: obviously, Wordle is very trendy and showcases how a limiter and sharing functionality creates a platform where people can compete and enjoy sharing their 'wins'

Original game: [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

Goals:

- Understand logic behind the game wordle
- Create the concept and then change it to make it the way that I'd like the gameplay
- Work on it daily and showcase what is going on

## Day 1

[X] Create the board  
[X] Create an input where we can type in the initial row  
[X] Once enter is pressed, check to see if the word is correct  
[X] Make it show which letters are almost there or correct.  
[X] Go to another row if not all complete  
[1/2] If complete, show that you win.

Thoughts about Day 1: It has been a blast! Basically, it was fun just to code something together and create a robust way of how the gameplay actually works. I decided because of this day that I'd continue on the project of making it my own and working on what I would do to it.

## Day 2

[X] Handles Error States (very minimal error handling)
[X] Is the word a real word?  
 [X] What if you press enter before the word is complete?  
[X] Winner  
 [X]] Presents a modal that allows you to share your stat  
 [1/2] Creates a copy of the clipboard of the emojis needed for them

## Day 3

To Be Determined

## Comments and Bugs

[X] Couldn't backspace after 5. 2/9/2022  
[X] Acceptance of fake words. 2/9/2022
[ ] Showing of the letters you've used.  
[ ] Special characters shouldn't be allowed.
[ ] When double letters in a word, I need to fix logic so it tracks right index.
